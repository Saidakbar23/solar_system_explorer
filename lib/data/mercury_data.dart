  'Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth\'s Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.',
  'Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system— that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.',
  'Mercury is slightly larger than our Moon - 15,329 kilometres around its equator. Its radius, the distance from the core\'s centre to the surface, is 2,440 kilometres. Mercury is about 2.6 times smaller than Earth.',
  'Mercury\'s sun-facing side is scorched by temperatures of around 430°C, hot enough to melt lead. Without a substantial atmosphere to distribute heat away from the areas facing the Sun, the planet\'s slow rotation makes for stark differences in temperature between its dark and light sides. The side facing away cools to an approximate -180°C.',
  'Mercury has little atmosphere, but what it does have is made up mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium. The thin atmosphere, or exosphere, does little to prevent or slow down impacts from extraterrestrial objects, leaving the surface littered with craters. In appearance it is similar to Earth\'s Moon.'
