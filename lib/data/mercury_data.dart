  'Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth\'s Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.',
  'Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system— that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.',
  'Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.',
  'Mercury\'s environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.',
  'With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.',
  'Mercury\'s highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet. Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days.',
  'Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.',
  'Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85% of the planet\'s radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury\'s outer shell, comparable to Earth\'s outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.',
  'Mercury\'s surface resembles that of Earth\'s Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors, including children\'s author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.',
