  'Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. Itâ€™s the hottest and brightest planet in our solar system.',
  'The scorching terrestrial (rocky) type planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty and is the only solar system planet named after a female.',
  'Venus is made up of a central iron core and a rocky mantle, similar in composition to Earth. But Venus\' hellish atmosphere is made up of mainly carbon dioxide (96%) and nitrogen (3.5%) with trace amounts of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, water vapour, argon, and helium making up the other 0.5%.',
  'Venus\' current environment is the result of a "greenhouse effect" that has allowed its massive CO2 atmosphere to intake the heat of the sun and retain that heat over time like a greenhouse for flowers here on Earth.',
