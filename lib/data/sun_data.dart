  'Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar system.',
  'The Sun is the star at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris – in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. ',
  'The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system, with a distance of 695,508 kilometres from centre to surface. It contains 99.86% of the mass of the entire solar system and could contain roughly 1.3 million Earths. The Sun is an average-sized star. Some stars are just a tenth of its size, while others are more than 700 times bigger. Due to its huge mass and strong gravity, the Sun is a near perfect sphere.',
  'The core is the hottest part of the Sun, at 15 million degrees Celsius. This is hot enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion, when hydrogen atoms are fused together to form larger helium atoms. This releases an extraordinary amount of energy which in turn is released as heat and light.',
  'It won\'t. When all of the hydrogen in its core is burned up, it exits the main sequence stage. As a relatively small star, the outer layers of the Sun will collapse in on themselves, creating temperatures hot enough to fuse helium into carbon. At this point the pressure will cause the star to rapidly expand outward to form a red giant. For the Sun, this is expected to occur in about five billion years. It is likely to engulf Mercury and Venus - and potentially even the Earth. It will eventually shrink to become a planetary nebula with a white dwarf at its core.'
